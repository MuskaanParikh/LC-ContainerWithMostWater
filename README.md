# LC - Container With Most Water

LEETCODE - Container With Most Water

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

Constraints:
```
- n == height.length
- 2 <= n <= 105
- 0 <= height[i] <= 104
```

## ðŸ“˜ Requirements
